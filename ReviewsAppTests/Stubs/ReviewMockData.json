      "message": "We loved Tempelhof, my 10yr old thought it was fantastic and probably one of his highlights of Berlin. The guide was brilliant and gave lots of information on both the history and the architecture. I would recommend this tour to anyone, however there is a lot of walking and most of it is up and down stairs, so make sure you\u2019re able to manage it before booking.",
